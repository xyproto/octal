# octal

Extremely simple package for octal numbers.

[API doc](https://godoc.org/github.com/xyproto/octal)

## Why?

An `Octal` has the potential to increase the safety of the code, since it ensures that `Octal` numbers will not be mixed with non-`Octal` numbers.

It can also be useful in connection with marshalling and unmarshalling of `XML`, `JSON`, `YAML` and `TOML` data.
